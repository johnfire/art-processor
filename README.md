# Art Processor - Phase 1

Automated painting metadata generation system for managing artwork files.
This program is set up to process new paintings on the users computer, then it will upload them to the artist website and to social media. eventually it will do all the  basic art management functions for an artist, including sending out letters to galleries, interior designers etc. it is being coded by claude AI with guidance from myself. i am trying to do ALL the coding with the AI and make architecutural and UX decisions only, as an experiement in using this technology. when finished it will be an AI agent for general use by artists everywhere, and my stepping stone to a new career.  enjoy! 

from here on this was all generated by claude, given careful prompting and decision making:

## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Claude's vision capabilities to analyze paintings
- **Title Generation**: Creates 5 diverse, gallery-quality title options
- **Professional Descriptions**: Generates collector-focused descriptions with visual analysis, emotional impact, and technical notes
- **Smart File Management**: Pairs and renames both big and Instagram versions of paintings
- **Extensible Metadata**: JSON and text output for easy integration with other systems
- **Interactive CLI**: Beautiful terminal interface for easy workflow

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Anthropic API key ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))
- Paintings organized in folder structure:
  ```
  Pictures/
  ├── my-paintings-big/
  │   ├── landscapes/
  │   ├── abstract/
  │   └── ...
  └── my-paintings-instagram/
      ├── landscapes/
      ├── abstract/
      └── ...
  ```

## Installation

1. **Clone/Download the project**

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   cd art-processor
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings:
   # - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   # - PAINTINGS_BIG_PATH=/path/to/your/Pictures/my-paintings-big
   # - PAINTINGS_INSTAGRAM_PATH=/path/to/your/Pictures/my-paintings-instagram
   # - METADATA_OUTPUT_PATH=/path/to/your/Pictures/processed-metadata
   ```

5. **Verify setup**
   ```bash
   python main.py verify-config
   ```

## Usage

### Process a Single Category

```bash
python main.py process --category landscapes
```

### Process All Categories

```bash
python main.py process --all
```

### List Available Categories

```bash
python main.py list-categories
```

## Workflow

When processing a painting, the system will:

1. **Display file information** - Shows both big and Instagram versions
2. **Analyze the image** - Extracts dimensions from EXIF data
3. **Generate 5 title options** - Diverse styles (poetic, descriptive, location-based, emotional, abstract)
4. **Prompt for title selection** - You choose your favorite
5. **Prompt for medium** - Select from: Oil, Watercolor, Acrylic, Drawing, Woodblock print
6. **Prompt for price** - Enter price in euros
7. **Suggest creation date** - From EXIF or file metadata (you can override)
8. **Generate description** - AI writes gallery-quality description based on your selections
9. **Rename files** - Both versions renamed to sanitized title (e.g., `bavarian_twilight.jpg`)
10. **Save metadata** - Creates both JSON and human-readable text files

## Output Structure

```
Pictures/processed-metadata/
└── landscapes/
    ├── bavarian_twilight.json
    └── bavarian_twilight.txt
```

### JSON Format

```json
{
  "filename_base": "bavarian_twilight",
  "category": "landscapes",
  "files": {
    "big": "/path/to/my-paintings-big/landscapes/bavarian_twilight.jpg",
    "instagram": "/path/to/my-paintings-instagram/landscapes/bavarian_twilight.jpg"
  },
  "title": {
    "selected": "Bavarian Twilight",
    "all_options": [
      "Golden Hour Over the Alps",
      "Bavarian Twilight",
      "Alpine Glow",
      "Evening Contemplation",
      "Sunset at 1200 Meters"
    ]
  },
  "description": "This watercolor captures the luminous quality...",
  "dimensions": "60cm x 80cm",
  "medium": "Watercolor",
  "price_eur": 450.0,
  "creation_date": "2025-01-15",
  "processed_date": "2025-02-07T15:30:00",
  "analyzed_from": "big"
}
```

## Extending the System

### Adding New Categories

Simply create new subfolders in both:
- `my-paintings-big/new_category/`
- `my-paintings-instagram/new_category/`

The system will auto-discover them.

### Adding New Mediums

Edit `config/settings.py`:

```python
MEDIUMS = [
    "Oil on canvas",
    "Watercolor",
    "Acrylic",
    "Drawing",
    "Woodblock print",
    "Mixed media",  # Add new ones here
    "Digital art",
]
```

### Customizing AI Prompts

Edit `config/prompts.py` to adjust:
- Title generation style
- Description format and content
- Tone and perspective

## Phase 2 (Future)

Phase 2 will add:
- FASO website automation (automatic upload)
- Social media posting (Instagram, Mastodon, Bluesky, etc.)
- Batch processing without interaction
- Web dashboard interface
- Scheduled/cron job support

## Troubleshooting

### "Anthropic API key: NOT configured"
- Make sure you've created `.env` from `.env.example`
- Add your actual API key to the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` field

### "No categories found"
- Verify your paths in `.env`
- Make sure folders exist and contain subfolders (categories)
- Run `python main.py verify-config` to check

### Image dimension detection returns pixels instead of cm
- Some images lack proper DPI metadata
- You can manually override dimensions after they're displayed

### "Module not found" errors
- Make sure virtual environment is activated: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
