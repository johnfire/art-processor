to install create a py venv , then use pip install requrirements.txt etc

you will need to create folders to store fotos of your paintings. ill add this tomorrow or have claude write a script to do it.

bascially you need folders that match your collections , and two master folders in one superfolder, my-paintings-big for high res fotos and my-paintings-instagram for social media size fotos.
